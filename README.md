# pillar-kata

Thank you for reviewing my kata submission to Pillar!

This project is the Roman Numeral kata (http://agilekatas.co.uk/katas/romannumerals-kata), built in Java via Gradle.

To build, please run "gradlew.bat assemble" (or "./gradlew assemble" for osx/linux. I think) on the root directory, which should create two runnable jars: toArabic/build/libs/toArabic.jar and toRomanNumeral/build/libs/toRomanNumeral.jar.

I opted for two separate, command-line-driven executable JARs as this seemed to most closely meet the desired output described in the kata.

To run each jar, you need simply "java -jar [jar] [input]".  There are no dependencies in the production code, so no classpaths to worry about.


Thank you again!
